# empdfer

Given a bunch of image files, empdfer embeds them into a PDF file, one image
per page.

It started as a use case of the
[paddlefish library](https://github.com/luis4a0/paddlefish), but it evolved as
a stand-alone application.

## Feature requests

Since there are many features to implement, I'd be happy to hear which new
features are useful to you. Open an issue with a feature request and I'll try
to address the implementation as soon as possible!
